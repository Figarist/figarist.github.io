excerpt: "The power was out. The cats were chaotic. The build still shipped. A typical Thursday."

Thursday started at 8:47 AM with Katsu screaming from the bathroom — the power had gone out, and apparently that was my fault.

## The Blackout Ritual

By now I have a system. UPS keeps the router alive for about 40 minutes. The laptop runs for 3 hours. The kettle is the first casualty. Coffee gets no sympathy from the energy grid.

Simona — the quiet one — found her spot on the warm laptop keyboard immediately, which is less "helpful" and more "a statement about priorities."

## The Build Window

I had one Unity build queued. 38 minutes left on the UPS when I started it. The build took 31 minutes. Katsu sat beside me the entire time watching the console output, unblinking, like he understood IL2CPP.

He did not. But he was *present*. There's something to that.

## What I Actually Shipped

A Wear OS haptic feedback prototype. Six particle emitter variants. One `SmoothStep` power curve that finally feels right.

Not bad for a Thursday with no coffee.
